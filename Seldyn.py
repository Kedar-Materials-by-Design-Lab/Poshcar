# Seldyn.py: package for manipulating selective dynamics parameters in POSCAR

# Andy Paul Chen, 28 March 2020 (Lockdown Day #5)

# A dude called Douglas G. Frank has been following the statistics on the pandemic.
# He believes that the inflection point for the spread comes at 29 March. That's tomorrow!
# Let's hope he is right!
# I have friends who might have contracted it. They have self-isolated. One of them, a very
# good friend of mine, lost his sense of smell and taste, but later got it back.
# May it stay that way!

# I am well save for a weird feeling in my soft palate. My body seems to be trying (but not
# very hard) to have a cold.
# I bought a bow and forearm guard for defense in the event of a societal meltdown. The arrows
# will come soon, hopefully.
